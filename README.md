For the last few months that I was on the team, I was responsible for programming a scalable UI system that could support up to 4 individual players controlling the menu all at the same time. I was given static designs made by Hannah Bailin in Figma, and I needed to create animations for each widget/component in the menu when interacted with and for each transition between menus. I was also responsible for writing the witty "tips" that appear in the loading screen.
