# That Damn Goat - UI Animations and Implementation

For the last few months that I was on the team, I was responsible for:
- Programming a scalable UI system that could support up to 4 individual players controlling the menu all at the same time
- Program a game state and loading manager to handle transitioning in and out of the game
- Recreate static designs (made by Hannah Bailin in Figma) in the Unity engine
- Creating animations for each widget/component in the menu when interacted with and for each transition between menus
- Writing the witty "tips" that appear in the loading screen.

That Damn Goat shipped on Steam and Nintendo Switch in 2023/2024.

(above) I developed an easy to use UI Navigation system for our game that lets multiple people join in/drop out and control the menu together. This is one of the tools for setting up an individual Menu Screen.
